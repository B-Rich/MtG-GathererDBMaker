MtG-GathererDBMaker
===================

Goes through all the card ids on Magic the Gathering's Gatherer tool and stores the information of each card into a database for use with an application.

Description
===========

This is a console application. When you run the application it will create a new database for you that contains all the information needed to make an application using all the cards known to Magic the Gathering. If there is a new expansion all you have to do is run it again and it makes a new updated database for you!
